## Agenda
- in general
  to decide what's on the agenda
    hit the beginning of each homework assignment
      do the first 1-2 together and set up the assignment
  process/expectations over content
    content is to be learned over the week
    we make sure they get how to do each thing
  make clear the outer limits of what's to be learned
    ie.   
      very clear learning objectives
      very clear learning un-objectives

## Homework

> SLACK!  Many of you have been asking us very good questions over slack, and many of you are asking the same questions!  This week ask all of your questions in your class's channel and tag us.  If you don't we won't know to answer

### JS

Do not only write quick solutions to the exercises to pass them. **We want you to understand more than we want you to pass a lot of exercises**.
If you don't finish everything but have understood what you finished, that's just ok.  Just be sure to let us know in your homework PR!

Really understanding the code means you could do the same work that pythontutor does but drawing yourself on a paper. To help you get there, there are all the great tools listed in the main README for this module. 

__basics__
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript): "Basics" throguh "counting cards" 
    * Copy your solutions into the freecode_camp_solutions_basic_js.MD file in your js-1 homework repo. Put code solutions in code blocks (\`\`\`) and add notes for yourself to make sure your crystallize your learnings

__Theory__
* [errors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janke-learning/errors/master/README.md) - redo this, split by feature and assign over the weeks
    * Copy-paste [errors exercises](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janke-learning/errors/master/README.md) into a new .md file in your homework repo. Solve the challenges and commit
* Variables: [swaps](https://github.com/janke-learning/variables-and-hoisting/blob/master/1-swaps.md), [multiple assignments on one line](https://github.com/janke-learning/variables-and-hoisting/blob/master/2-multiple-assignments.md)
* functions: [exercises 1](https://github.com/colevandersWands/function-exercises/blob/master/1-functions.md), [turtle shuffle](https://github.com/colevandersWands/function-exercises/blob/master/2-turtle-shuffle.md)

__Practice__
* [cross-module project, week 1]()




### Git & GitHub
* [learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - intro sequence
