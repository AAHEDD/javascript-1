# Week 1

you'll be learning the first workings of JavaScript as a language in isolation (the homeworks), experimenting with it in context (the project), and getting serious about GitHub issues & pull requests (assignment submission & feedback).

## Agenda

In class we'll go over the first tastes of JS, but the main point of class will be making sure you know how to complete and submit your homework assignments.  We'll start each assignment together to get you started for the week, and make sure you know what to study over the week



### homework setup
* create github accounts - USE YOUR REAL NAME
* fork the [project](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module) & [homework](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework) repos
* setup the week-1 tables in the [class-5 wiki](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBEHomework/class-5/wiki/module-2---JS-1)

### Using GitHub
* what is it, what's it for
* [pull requesting](https://github.com/janke-learning/pull-requesting) - practicing this with 3-4 others  will help your turn in your homework

### JS
* [what is it, what's it for](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)
* stepping through & predicting execution: [python tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#), [notional machines](https://github.com/janke-learning/js-notional-machine)
* using [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
* [parsons problems](https://janke-learning.org/parsonizer/)
* kick-off homework 
    * [FCC basic JS](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/fcc-basic-js-pt-1.md)
    * [errors](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-errors-formatting.md)
    * [variables](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-variables-swaps.md) 
    * [functions](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/blob/master/week-1/jl-functions.md)

### projects launch off
* what's this about
* get set up together
* js in-context
* user stories & incremental development
* github pages

### sendoff
* everyone pr's that their homework is not ready
* assign learngitbranching

## Homework

> SLACK!  Many of you have been asking us very good questions over slack, and many of you are asking the same questions!  This week ask all of your questions in your class's channel and tag us.  If you don't we won't know to answer

### Homework Priority

* :seedling: : must finish
* :dash: : must start
* :fire: : challenge

### JS

Do not only write quick solutions to the exercises to pass them. **We want you to understand more than we want you to pass a lot of exercises**.
If you don't finish everything but have understood what you finished, that's just ok.  Just be sure to let us know in your homework PR!

Really understanding the code means you could do the same work that pythontutor does but drawing yourself on a paper. To help you get there, there are all the great tools listed in the main README for this module. 

* [JS 1, week 1 homework](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/week-1) - follow the link to see which assignments are required


### Project
* :seedling: [cross-module project, week 1](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/week-1)


### Git & GitHub
* :seedling: send a pull-request to [class-5 repo](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBEHomework/class-5/tree/master/bios) containing a short bio.
* :dash: [learn git branching intro sequence](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

Most simply: if it takes one step in python tutor, it's a statement.  If it has an operator, it's an expression.  A line of code can be both a statement and an expression
