## Homework

> SLACK!  Many of you have been asking us very good questions over slack, and many of you are asking the same questions!  This week ask all of your questions in your class's channel and tag us.  If you don't we won't know to answer

### Homework Priority

* :seedling: : must finish
* :dash: : must start
* :fire: : challenge

### JS

Do not only write quick solutions to the exercises to pass them. **We want you to understand more than we want you to pass a lot of exercises**.
If you don't finish everything but have understood what you finished, that's just ok.  Just be sure to let us know in your homework PR!

Really understanding the code means you could do the same work that pythontutor does but drawing yourself on a paper. To help you get there, there are all the great tools listed in the main README for this module. 

* [JS 1, week 1 homework](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-homework/week-1) - follow the link to see which assignments are required


### Project
* :seedling: [cross-module project, week 1](https://github.com/be-hacking-hyf/javascript-1-cross-module/week-1)


### Git & GitHub
* :seedling: [pull requesting](https://github.com/janke-learning/pull-requesting) - practicing this with 3-4 others  will help your turn in your homework
* :dash: [learn git branching intro sequence](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

* [operators](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/fundamentals/blob/master/fundamentals/operators.md)
* statements vs expressions: [one](https://en.hexlet.io/courses/intro_to_programming/lessons/expressions/theory_unit), [two](https://dev.to/promhize/javascript-in-depth-all-you-need-to-know-about-expressions-statements-and-expression-statements-5k2). Most simply: if it takes one step in python tutor, it's a statement.  If it has an operator, it's an expression.  A line of code can be both a statement and an expression
