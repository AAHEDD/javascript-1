As with the homeworks from _HTML, CSS & GitHub_ you'll be expected to complete the __JavaScript-1__ exercises in your fork of this repository.  Also like the homeworks from last module, your JS-1 exercises will be a live web-page.  When all the tests are passed page is all green!

This folder is a little intro to the exercises you can expect to study, and a tutorial on how to use the ```evaluate``` function to test and study your code in the devtools as you work your way through the exercises.

In this folder there are 4 JS files you can to study to understand how the ```evaluate``` function works and how it can help you learn JS from the browser's devtools.  Be sure to read the source code _and_ the live exercises!:
1. [About ```evaluate```](./about-evaluate.js):  The first thing for you to understand is that ```evaluate``` is not magic!  All it does is run your function, compare inputs to outputs, and display all of that information in your devtools console in a helpful way.  You can do everything ```evaluate``` does by hand using plain JavaScript, it just won't look as pretty in the devtools :)
1. [Implementation Exercises](./implementation.js):
1. [Behavior Exercises](./behavior.js)
1. [Mixed](./mixed.js)
1. [Native Code](./native-code.js)

> For best results, study the source code in VSC _and_ the .html in your browser!
