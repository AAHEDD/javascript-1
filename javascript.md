# javascript

The first step towards becoming a code master is to become JavaScript.  

1. Memorize the basic language features in JS.
2. Step through simple scripts exactly like the computer does.

Neither of these skills are as easy as the sound, and both of them are the foundation for everything else to come.  Your end goal is to write applications large and small that provide practical solutions to real-world problems, but this is for later.  You won't be able to do this until you've mastered your primary tool - __the JavaScript language__.  

No matter how smart you are, or how good you are at what you did before learning to code, be prepared to struggle.  This is totally normal.  Being good at programming (or learning it quickly) are not indicators of how intelligent you are.  They are indicators of how close your thinking style is to that of a computer programmer.  

_Don't be discouraged!_  If you master these fundamentals now, you will be prepared to learn the principles of software development and real-world problem solving. 

So study hard! Dig in now, and keep at it every day.  The more you prepare, the more everyone will benefit.

## Specifications

1. Set aside a chapter in your notes for JavaScript language features:    
  * You'll want to build your own 'vocabulary list' to keep track of the built-in JS language features as you come across them.  One of the most common difficulties in the early stages of programming is just remembering all of the language features available!  
  * Having a complete list of everything you know, written in your own words, will be invaluable as you try to start to solve programming challenges on your own.
  * Start building a collection of clear code samples & sketches that have helped you understand key concepts, we recommend trying to store them in a directory of Markdown files.   
2. Familiarize yourself with these JS study tools: 
  * [PythonTutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) - learn how JS carries out your instructions behind the scenes
  * [Parsonizer](https://janke-learning.github.io/parsonizer) - turn any snippet into a study exercise
  * [blocks editor](https://janke-learning.github.io/blockit) (work in progress, does not support ES6) - for a little help while JS syntax is still new to you
  * [browser console](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66420/how-do-you-launch-the-javascript-debugger-in-google-chrome) - paste and run JS snippets from any browser tab
  * [linter](https://janke-learning.github.io/linter) - get helpful tips about bad habits or potential errors
  * [spot](https://janke-learning.github.io/spot) - quiz yourself on JS key words and syntax
  * [flow vizualization](https://janke-learning.github.io/flowviz) - automatically visualize program logic with flow charts
  * [code along](https://janke-learning.github.io/code-along) - save helpful snippets and notes from class-time or group study sessions
4. Practice whatever keeps you motivated. If you find one tutorial too easy, hard, or boring, move on!  What's important is that you can predict how JS will execute simple programs, not the tutorials you complete.

## Resources

Below are some recommended resources for learning JavaScript.  Take a look at each one and see what works best for you.  If you find another one you like better, send it our way and we'll put it up!

What is JS?
* ["Preface" from __You Don't Know JS__](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/preface.md)
* ["Intro" from __JavaScript.info__](https://javascript.info/intro)
* ["What is JS" from __Practical JavaScirpt__](https://shawnr.gitbooks.io/practical-introduction-to-javascript/content/what-is-javascript/)
* ["What is JS" from __MDN__](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)


Great online Tutorials:
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) & [video series](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/my-giant-javascript-basics-course-is-now-live-on-youtube-and-its-100-free-9020a21bbc27) - Great community support.  To get the most out of FCC, continue studying each exercise even after getting your green check mark. Parsonize your solutions, study them in Python Tutor, run them in the console, Spot them.  It's also worth your time to find at least three solutions to each challenge.
* Headfirst JavaScript: [PDF](http://wickedlysmart.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Head_First_JavaScript_Programming_SampleChapter.pdf), [GitHub](https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-JavaScript-Programming) - very thorough and hand-held introduction to using JS in simple websites. You will learn from this even if nothing else works.
* [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com) - Fun website with good examples to study.
* [javascript, the weird parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts) - (advanced)


General JS References 
* [Javascript.info](https://javascript.info). General Reference for JavaScript, DOM
