## Agenda


### preview

### JS
https://github.com/janke-learning/implicit-coercion/blob/master/study-the-plus-operator.md
  study this in class 
"implicit coercion" repo, build replication together in class
  use code-along to save steps along the way
  share saved file & link afterwards
  tdd light
  rebuild this
    refactor the replicationing into a replicationing repo
      run_tests it
      mention tdd
    leave the rest as just examples to study
